# GPA-PlusPlus
GPA++ is a customized GPA calculator system designed to help my colleagues at the university track and optimize their academic performance. GPA++ allows them to easily calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA) across multiple semesters and courses. If their GPA is less than 2, the system will suggest courses to register for to help improve it.
